project is fully open source, and you can use the code for any purpose (it will be nice if you credit 8AAFFF and all contributors tho)

To run the build:

1. Download Windows release from the [Releases](https://github.com/marmust/internet-scanner/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file to a new folder
3. Run `graph renderer.exe`
3. You may get an error saying "Windows Protected Your PC". This is normal, click the `more options` link, then click the `Run Anyway` button.

The build is only for windows however, you're out of luck if you run any other OS.

To open the Unity Project:
1. Make sure Unity is installed properly on your system (the project is currently being developed in version: `2020.3.35F1`).
> Please note: If you do not have version `2020.3.35f1` installed, nor see the option to install it in Unity Hub, simply try opening the project in Unity Hub anyways. Unity Hub will prompt you to install the correct version.
2. Download the `graph renderer unity project` directory from the parent directory: [Unity_stuff](https://github.com/marmust/internet-scanner/tree/main/Unity_stuff)
3. Open the Unity Launcher.
4. Select: "Import and existing project" (The wording might have changed since the last time I used Unity 5+ years ago, but it should be similar).
5. Navigate to where you put your `graph renderer unity project` directory and select it. (GitHub will download the folder as a `.zip` so you'll have to unzip it first.
6. Have fun!
